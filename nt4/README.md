# Network Tables 4

Network Tables 4 is conceptually similar to NT3 but has many small differences.

This example illustrates a simple publisher, which is mostly what we need on the robot.

It's just from the [docs](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-docs/blob/main/source/docs/software/networktables/robot-program.rst).
