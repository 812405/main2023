# Lynxmotion Arm Example

Mr Hopkins and Mr Truher visited the maker club room on Sep 17, hoping to find the Fanuc
arm that Mr Krauskopf remembered.  We found it, but it's complicated and not that useful.
So we were disappointed, but as we were leaving we discovered about twenty servo-based
arms that seem to be the [Lynxmotion AL5D](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-al5d-pltw-robotic-arm-assembled.html),
a six-degree-of-freedom arm used years ago in the PLTW curriculum.

This project is the simplest control system I could think of.
